I have been in Agile Journey for 4 years and acted as the role of team member, scrum master and agile coach. ","The Agile Manifesto has made a big impact on software development around the world in a matter of 10 years. Granted, we're not done yet. But we've made significant progress. However, it seems the Arctic Ocean will have melted before we see traditional management being replaced with a new paradigm.'-- David Bornstein, How to change the world [David, 2007] 

We change our traditional management to Lean and Agile leadership by changing the environment which is called Environment Driven Development. Through the presentation, we will tell you the theory combined with our practices during this 4 years' deployment. Instead of changing the people themselves, how change our people's behavior through changing the environment systematically, including the hard environment, soft environment and development environment. 

We will also share the result we got and the lessons we learnt by changing the environment. You will hear a lot of interesting practical stories happened in this period of environment change; you can also hear the voices from the team members feedback.",2,3,2, - ,Weijia Lu,E10F Taiwan Island,F17 Xian,6F Uranus,F4 Persedetial 1,NB 203
Make Agile Journey Smooth by Leveraging In-house Developed CI Framework,10/16/2013 13:00,10/16/2013 14:00,Meeting Room 3,"manager of Infrastructure team, NDO SP, PDU IP System, DUIB","This presentation will explain how we in NDO Smart Packet by leveraging our CI Framework gradually improve design and test efficiency and how our PM/LM use the data presented on CI FW for a better management of the project & team.
As a product development responsible organization, we need to have very short feedback loop to secure productivity, quality and flexibility. 
Before we have our CI FW, our XFTs had to separately trigger some development activities (typically for SW upgrade and regression test) manually and wait till the previous step to complete then trigger the next step.  This way we think we didn't utilize the time and our HW in an efficient way. 
Furthermore, to do the Agile transformation we don't want the top-down directive mode, instead we want our XFTs to take initiatives to find out the approach for improvement and become self-organized. Then we think a CI FW is needed to facilitate the team.
The NDO SP CI FW is an end-to-end responsible and easy-to-use framework which helps get each link in the SW engineering chain (SW build -> static code analysis -> UT -> SW upgrade -> regression -> coverage report -> execution result notification) connected. And also with the consolidated and easy-to-reach result summary, engineers can do trouble shooting easily. As a consequence, team's working efficiency is improved a lot. With the job queuing function, the idle time between test jobs is further reduced and  the HW utilization ratio are greatly improved.
In Agile environment, transparency is important in the sense that it makes progress & dependency & impediments visible, so that it makes communication between teams or even between team and PM/LM more effective and efficient. The visualized information can also function as a push force for teams to continuously strive for an even better result. The abundant subjective data (e.g. result summary of each step, trend for each step) presented on CI FW works facilitate teams to reflect on in which area they are doing good and in which area they are not, then proactive actions can be taken immediately.
With the visualized and consolidated information on out CI FW about each team's work, together with the real time TR statistics info provided by our TR dashboard, it makes it easier for PM/LM to have a good understanding about current quality status and quality risks of our product.
Without proper tools?? support, our Agile transformation wouldn't get to current lever so smoothly. 
Want to hear more detail or even some real cases about how we gradually address our problems one by one along the journey to Agile by leveraging our CI framework? Come to our presentation.",2,4,2, - ,Ke Li,A4F Galaxy(A413),F17 Kunming,5F Mars,F2 Wudang,MB A105
Best Practices On Gerrit Based Code Review,10/16/2013 13:00,10/16/2013 14:00,Meeting Room 7,"Vivian, join Ericsson from 2008, working as CM(configuration management) including product/project CM and software CM for 5 years. Also as BUSS SH CM discipline driver, I hosted several workshop internal, like git workshop & CI workshop with Guangzhou ,Beijing and Shanghai which across organizations. I??m focus on git/gerrit and Jenkins more than 3 years. And love them so much!","Since more and more colleague changing from clearcase to git/gerrit, and gerrit based code review is the one of the best way to enhance our code quality. 
At the beginning we always encounter some difficulties and strive to find the better way to increase our efficiency and really hope the tool could help us in daily work. 
How to use the tools in smart way? How about the strategy? which is the best approach? which solution to choose for different business needs?  
So in my presentation I will introduce:
firstly, why code review? will cover basic concept and types of code review, and give a brief introduction about structure and fundamental of git, gerrit and Jenkins, also let you know how gerrit do the code review
Secondly, some good experience on how deploy gerrit, there are approach you could choose by business needs, these good activity comes from different site, some are task based code review, some are feature based code review etc. it's very flexible and could customized by project. And give some reason behind why you select the strategy and what's the benefit.

Our Agile Transformation Journey,10/16/2013 14:00,10/16/2013 14:00,Meeting Room 5,"I'm Ariel HAN, from Beijing CBC/XEL department. I'm a software engineer and the Scrum master of one team.","Our team is working for the CMCC fast track feature development and lab test support.
Our project condition:
1. Receive many TR/Issues from lab test everyday and the number couldn't be estimated;
2. Too many urgent and high priority features are inserted which break the previous plan;
3. Multi features/TR/Issues on one's hand and are switched frequently. 
4. The features could be started or cancelled in a very short time. 
To adapt agile to our project, we:
1. Shorten our sprint to 2 weeks to avoid suddenly coming features which couldn't wait for the next sprint.
2. Involve feature pre-study of next sprint to current sprint to do a earlier forecast and requirement understanding.
3. Build up team competence as deepen their own design area and broaden to others. Let feature relative members share the key and short information to make others better involved in those not 'self relative' tasks.\
4. Combine Kanban and Scrum together. 
How do we decide putting one task into Kanban or Scrum?
- We have both work package PO and TR PO, working together for the task assignment and priority decision.
- Tasks with high priority, easy to estimate and hard to be removed during 1 sprint will be added in Scrum.
- Tasks as TRs, Issues, feature verification support, workshop, pre-study ect will be added in Kanban.
How does PO balance the Scrum and Kanban work?
- 2mhr security time for Kanban, could be added in planning meeting according to tasks' priority.
- If we commit more on Kanban, then we commit less on Scrum and vice versa.
How do we run the daily standup meeting?
- One board, two diagram (burn-down chart for scrum, task effort chart for kanban)
- Update Scrum and Kanban tasks status, check our speed and decide what to do today. If faster on Scrum, someone could be involved more in Kanban.
- All done in 15min, list all block issues and make group discussion after the meeting.
 
Why do we put sharing tasks in Kanban?
- In Scrum, sharing is too easy to be removed by inserted tasks, so we didn't put it into scrum because it always left at the end...
- In Kanban, when someone has no ongoing task, he could put the sharing tasks into Kanban immediately.
- In Kanban, new sharing task could be created immediately when we fix some issues or finish some pre-study to avoid forgetting it.
 
How do we check the result on the sprint end?
- For Scrum,  we will check how many committed User Stories have pass.
- For Kanban, we will check how many TR/Issues/Sharing we finished. Pick out the tasks stay in Kanban for a long time for lesson learned.

Elegant Automation Test in Agile,10/16/2013 14:00,10/16/2013 15:00,Meeting Room 7,"I have played different roles -- developer, tester, test leader, system analyzer, scrum master and agile testing coach, and my automation test experience started since 2007 while my agile experience started since 2008. 
During the pass 6+ years, I work with the team to keep practicing and improving automation test framework and strategy, to make the automation more elegant and more effective to support the team to deliver high quality product as well as enjoying automation test.","Automation test is the key to successful agile development, which frees the team to deliver high-quality code frequently. Automated build, deployment and test scripts ensure reliability as well as allow the team to do its best work at all times. 
 
While in the real word, there're always some actual barriers: 
--The code tends to change frequently during development, how can automated tests catch up with it?
-- The GUI automation test always cost a lot of effort, how can we change it from dark ages to successfully automation in an agile environment?
-- End-to-end tests are particularly tricky to automate, how can we implement it elegantly?
-- The team has hundreds, even thousands of automated test cases to maintain, if we fail to easily making the changes to existing test, the big suited of automated test cases can turn into headache. How can we avoid this?
-- Writing automation test for legacy code with few or no tests is a daunting task, how can we complete them while at the same time working for new code?
-- When iteration doesn't??t proceed smoothly and the team failed to complete the tasks planned, automation test will always be the task don't have time to finish, how can we avoid it?
 
How can we overcome these barriers? How can automation test let the team maximize its velocity while maintaining a high standard?
In this presentation, we would share some practical experience on:
-- How to apply agile values, principles and practices to develop automation test strategy in agile development
-- How to develop an elegant automation framework to support the team's effective automated tests

Looking forward to exchange ideas with you in the conference.,"No matter you are running traditional team or scrum team, to motivate team member is always a big challenge of lean managers/Scrum masters. Despite what we usually do to encouraging people taking challenge, is there other way around to build a team that is always asking What We Can Change? Yes, one of the approach that you can try is making things visible. Including achievement/lesson learned/project status/responsibility.. Everything that can be visible, make them being visible as much as possible.

From this presentation, we will have a deep dive on two typical scenarios on traditional team operation; newly formed scrum team. Then we can see how team member feel great by advertising/visualizing their achievement. How we can increase the trust between team members by talking/posting about achievement. How we handle failures. And some suggestion you should be careful when you want to go with this approach.

During this time he has been a part of the transformation of testing towards an Agile way of working and has been driving this change.","Abstract description:     Quality control in Agile in BUSS Shanghai 
Agile is implemented long time ago in BUSS shanghai. What we care about is not only the WoW, but the product quality and efficiency. Better quality control is always our focus. Several good practice to share here. 
Content: 
1. Short Quality feedback loop 
All products in BUSS Shanghai share common CI strategy/guide make our quality insurance work visualized in time. Examples of product adaption for different situation, we continuously learn from others's strong points to offset one's weakness and share environment setup work to be more efficient. 
Useful tools integrated with CI work to control each phase quality. Such as Gerit for code review; Sonar for better monitor and control UT coverage; Heatmap, track FT failed cases as input of later test anatomy and case improvement; Jacoco, another angle of test coverage; Zabbix, performance ST report of system usage. 

2. Quality feedback loop by FST (Fault Slip Through), which bring deeper analysis on why and how to improve. 
 Through analysis->feedback->deploy, each party of the product insurance (requirement owner, technical writer, designer, tester) keep improving our quality in each area. 

Learning of those practice: 
The first step is make product quality visualization timely, different time loop for different purpose. Not only visible but also stable and automized framework make us focus on product quality itself. 
CI means not only Continuous Integration but also Continuous Improvement. During product development, we use variable kinds of feedback loop to make us take effort on the right direction and right way.",2,5,2, - ,Johan Bengtsson & Lily Zhang,A4F Innovation Room,F16 Hangzhou,6F Venus,F4 Open area,MB A106

to become the most like a psychological analysis, the most affinity interactive way. 

In Agile WoW, it highly focus on interactions between people. Therefore, communication becomes more and more important. Art is a way to communicate more transparently,
deeply and funnily. During four years journey of Agile, we practiced many art activities in our ceremonies as: 
-Literature 
-Aesthetics 
-Filmology 
-Architecture 
In this presentation, we will share our good practices all about Art! From these artistic activities, we can hear voice from team member??s heart and communicate deeply in the soul. 
Moreover, these artistic activities are quite novel and interesting. Let's say that ""Lean and Agile is not only a theory, we can also fill in them with a lot of fun!""",2,6,2, - ,Clare Bao,A3F Leo(A317),F16 Nanjing,5F Earth,F3 Qin,MB A103
The Power of Retrospective,10/16/2013 15:30,10/16/2013 16:30,Ballroom B,"Linda Rising is a well-known and well-respected independent consultant who lives in Nashville, Tennessee. 

She has authored four books and numerous articles and is an internationally known presenter on topics related to patterns, retrospectives, influence strategies, agile development, and the change process.","Project Retrospectives are an important part of any software development process. 

The Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto state that, ""At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."" 

How can this be done? 

By taking the time to reflect and learn and proactively determine what should be done differently in the next iteration, release, or project. 

Linda's presentation will introduce techniques for project retrospectives, whether they are agile or not. The techniques help teams discover what they're doing well so that successful practices can continue and identify what should be done differently to improve performance. Retrospectives are not finger pointing or blaming sessions, but rather a highly effective process in which teams reflect on the past to become more productive in the future. 

Linda will share her experiences with leading retrospectives of several kinds for dozens of projects - successful and unsuccessful, small and large, in academia and industry. Her lessons learned can be applied to any project to enable teams and organizations to become learning organizations.

Many factors impact the final decisions:  capacity, competence, strategy, schedule, cost, flexibility, stability, etc., in some extend, it's ""the art of balance"".
 
When a feature is not big enough therefore it doesn't need the whole XFT, how to handle the idle resources? Normally the demands to resource are up and down through the whole feature lifecycle, how to keep the team stable while the resource can still be utilized efficiently? When product line and release PM require a feature commitment at the early stage of a feature, how to balance the flexibility and the commitment? These are the challenges I face everyday.

Roy Ke, from BNET DUCI CDMA Core. Now I am working on continuous integration for GSM-N.","Stories of CI Evolution Journey

This is a joint presentation from DUIB China R&D Ops and DUCI GZ.

As we always say, Agile transformation is a journey. It is also a journey to setup a Continuous Integration framework for a project from scratch. 

In DUIB China NDO SP, we started our CI journey in year 2011. When we look back, there are lots of exciting achievements along the road.  DUIB China CI maturity model evaluates CI deployment from 5 dimensions which are building, deploying, testing, reporting and culture. It's a frame of reference for us to self-inspect on ""where we are"" and ""where to go"". Based on the measurement in the model, NDO SP has finished a giant leap from ""BASE"" level to ""INTERMEDIATE"" level in most of the dimensions. In the presentation, we will share our essential train of thought and good practices to our audience.

In GUCI GZ, we are deploying CI upon a legacy system --GSM-N, which has served TELCO over 40 years. During our way to CI, private system in GSM-N is the biggest impediment. After a bout one year's adventure, now we have achieved LLV building and LLV/LSV verification in our CI platform. Here we'd like to share our experiences on dealing with legacy and private systems, hope it can help teams who are facing same problems.

Without strong interpersonal communication and facilitation skills, the process can fail, leading towards lack of understanding of what the users really wish. In this talk, I try to show a path to overcome these obstacles by mindmapping.
Through the simplicity and serenity of mind mapping, we will explore the""User Wish"" - a vague shape of requirements before they are formalized. And turn them into user stories or use cases.  This session includes a demonstration of the user interview using mindmapping techniques.

","At the beginning of agile journey, we may often face a same problem. ""Are we going to use Scrum or Kanban?"" For the pure XFTs, it is easy for them to choose. But for
some teams who play a different role within a R&D organization, it is not easy. LSV team in NDO IPOS and Infrastructure team in NDO SP are two typical examples.
They both chose Scrum at the start. They had almost everything needed in a Scrum setup, like Scrum master, planning meeting, retrospective meeting and demo ect.

But after running for several sprints, they both met obstacles. The high priority tasks kept coming in now and then. The sprint plan was interrupted. They can not 
finish all the planned tasks to meet the schedule.

Then they started to think about change. And they turned to Kanban. Without time box limited, they can easily handle the incoming urgent tasks and prioritize the backlog
more freely. They focused more on the work flow. Team members work more closely and the quality is secured as well.

","In SGSN-MME product, we have around 8000 TTCN test cases and 35000 GTT (a function test tool for SGSN-MME) test cases for function test, normally each test case needs more than 10 seconds to execute. Nowadays we can finish one TTCN regression within 15 minutes and one GTT regression within 1 hour on average. But back to 2009, the figures to finish one TTCN regression and GTT regression were 20 hours and 8 hours. 

My presentation introduces how our infrastructure department helps reduce this regression time and shorten the feedback loop from days to minutes in the past 5 years.  In the presentation, I will show what we have done within infrastructure area, how we use and deploy distributed system, virtualization technology and selective regression method to our regression testing. Distributed system and virtualization technology let us have the capacity to execute more regressions, and selective regression method provides a smart way to reduce regression scope and improve the efficiency. All of these tools and technologies have been integrated in our integration process to support our product's CI deployment.

","
For DUCI PDU CDMA R&D, when we move from waterfall development model to agile WoW, our previous TL9000 quality management system becomes partly obsolete though it was quite excellent in managing the products quality in waterfall model before. During this transformation, the team gains obvious benefits from Agile WoW such as quick delivery, flexibility, productivity, but people also start to concern that in Agile WoW the processes and documents may be easily sacrificed, hence the quality might be depressed. Especially our major NA customers have a requirement for the suppliers to be TL9000 certified.
Just like Agile manifesto stresses, ""while we value working software and individual interactions more, there is still value in processes and documents"".  Hence to better leverage the both, we adjusted the old quality management system in a lean approach and defined our Agile WoW with compliancy to TL9000 requirements during our Agile transformation. This presentation will talk about how we run agile in a way that fulfills TL9000 requirements on: 
Simplify processes to avoid overhead on processes/documents; 
Clarify a minimum set of documents and records to satisfy TL9000 audit and to ensure quality and maintainability of the product.
Simplified project planning/management and focus on sprint-based delivery.
More flexible change management.
Keep requirement traceability.
Control of documents and records.

I have worked in Ericsson for 6 years, and 2 years?? experience on coaching team and individuals.","Test-driven development (TDD is a method of software development in which unit testing is repeatedly done on source code. The concept is to ""get something working now and perfect it later."" TDD can produce applications of high quality in less time than is possible with older methods. Proper implementation of TDD requires the developers and testers to accurately anticipate how the application and its features will be used in the real world. Because tests are conducted from the very beginning of the design cycle, time and money spent in debugging at later stages is minimized. 

In this workshop, firstly we will introduce TDD's concept and values. Then we would invite you to experience how to use TDD - a small hands-on programming game with TDD method. After your participation, I believe you will definitely know the importance of TDD in programming. Of course, you would probably find out some challenges to use TDD. Do not worry about it. We will guide you to brainstorm how to overcome the limitations in our TDD Journey. 

We believe that there must be certain proper ways to start our TDD journey in our development. We can continue to improve the quality daily and daily via TDD.

PDU WMR conclusion  - What should we do about Flow?  - How should we treat Cost of Delay?  - How to manage queues?  - What does Flow and Queuing theory help us to increase productivity and feature delivery?   PDU WMR Practice in Flow product development:  - WCDMA has doubled its delivery (number of feature), comfortably release on time. The momentum of productivity increasing is still strong.  - Reducing TR dramatically on both Main and PLM track after 18 month Agile transformation. We are reducing PLM team each year.  - WCDMA is aiming for delivering SW each Sprint to SP instead few release each year in 2014.

A full Multiservice Delivery Platform (MSDP) package is integrated by 300+ components/modules, which are developed by ~100 engineers. In order to make everything integrated in time and keep the product quality always visualized, Continuous Integration (CI) is well developed and managed in MSDP to ensure everything goes smoothly and refreshed frequently. 

CI setup in MSDP includes the functionalities to automatically and continuously do: 
- Timely component building, unit testing and code reviewing ; 
- Hourly product package integrating, deploying and system testing; 
- Nightly formal package delivering; 
- Daily performance testing; 
- Weekly duration testing; 

Smart, clear and well organized CI systems are the key to make above jobs working smoothly, especially when the branch and job numbers are big (6 CI systems in MSDP and 100+ jobs in each CI system).  High efficient CI setup, good quality control and useful Jenkins plugins make MSDP CI in an efficient way.

From environment setting, product building, deploying, testing and reporting perspective, MSDP CI is mostly in Advanced level. Let's improve together!
