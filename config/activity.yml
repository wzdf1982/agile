  Abstract: "\x18The Agile Manifesto has made a big impact on software development
    around the world in a matter of 10 years. Granted, we are not done yet. But we

    Environment Driven Development. Through the presentation, we will tell you the
    theory combined with our practices during this 4 years\x19 deployment. Instead
    of changing the people themselves, how change our people's behavior through changing
    the environment systematically, including the hard environment, soft environment
    and development environment. \n\nWe will also share the result we got and the

  Title: Make Agile Journey Smooth by Leveraging In-house Developed CI Framework
  Start time: 10/16/2013 13:00
  Stop time: 10/16/2013 14:00
  Room of Beijing: Meeting Room 3
  Speaker Introduction: manager of Infrastructure team, NDO SP, PDU IP System, DUIB
  Abstract: "This presentation will explain how we in NDO Smart Packet by leveraging
    our CI Framework gradually improve design and test efficiency and how our PM/LM
    use the data presented on CI FW for a better management of the project & team.\nAs
    a product development responsible organization, we need to have very short feedback
    loop to secure productivity, quality and flexibility. \nBefore we have our CI
    FW, our XFTs had to separately trigger some development activities (typically
    for SW upgrade and regression test) manually and wait till the previous step to
    complete then trigger the next step.  This way we think we didn't utilize the
    time and our HW in an efficient way. \nFurthermore, to do the Agile transformation
    we don't want the top-down directive mode, instead we want our XFTs to take initiatives
    to find out the approach for improvement and become self-organized. Then we think
    a CI FW is needed to facilitate the team.\nThe NDO SP CI FW is an end-to-end responsible
    and easy-to-use framework which helps get each link in the SW engineering chain
    (SW build -> static code analysis -> UT -> SW upgrade -> regression -> coverage
    report -> execution result notification) connected. And also with the consolidated
    and easy-to-reach result summary, engineers can do trouble shooting easily. As
    a consequence, team's working efficiency is improved a lot. With the job queuing
    function, the idle time between test jobs is further reduced and  the HW utilization
    ratio are greatly improved.\nIn Agile environment, transparency is important in
    the sense that it makes progress & dependency & impediments visible, so that it
    makes communication between teams or even between team and PM/LM more effective
    and efficient. The visualized information can also function as a push force for
    teams to continuously strive for an even better result. The abundant subjective
    data (e.g. result summary of each step, trend for each step) presented on CI FW
    works facilitate teams to reflect on in which area they are doing good and in
    which area they are not, then proactive actions can be taken immediately.\nWith
    the visualized and consolidated information on out CI FW about each team??s work,
    together with the real time TR statistics info provided by our TR dashboard, it "

  Abstract: "Since more and more colleague changing from clearcase to git/gerrit,
    and gerrit based code review is the one of the best way to enhance our code quality.
    \nAt the beginning we always encounter some difficulties and strive to find the
    better way to increase our efficiency and really hope the tool could help us in
    daily work. \nHow to use the tools in smart way? How about the strategy? which
    is the best approach? which solution to choose for different business needs?  \nSo
    in my presentation I will introduce:\nfirstly, why code review? will cover basic
    concept and types of code review, and give a brief introduction about structure
    and fundamental of git, gerrit and Jenkins, also let you know how gerrit do the
    code review\nSecondly, some good experience on how deploy gerrit, there are approach
    you could choose by business needs, these good activity comes from different site,
    some are task based code review, some are feature based code review etc. it??s
    very flexible and could customized by project. And give some reason behind why
    you select the strategy and what??s the benefit.\n"

  Room of Beijing: Ballroom B
  Speaker Introduction: "Kenji Hiranabe is an Agile software development practitioner
    and consultant in Japan. He thinks of software development as a form of co-operative
    communication game, and is always searching for better ways to make it more productive,
    collaborative, and fun. \n\n2008 Gordon Pask Award Recipient for contributions
    to Agile practice. CEO of Change Vision Inc., and Japanese (co-)translator of
    the books including \"Multi-Paradigm Design\", \"C# Primer\", \"Lean Software
    Development\", \"XP Installed\", \"Agile Project Management\". Also a developer
    of \"JUDE\" a UML editor software integrated with Mind Mapping, and \"TRICHORD,\"
    a Kanban-based Agile project information sharing tool. "
  Abstract: Now that Agile methods have become mainstream in software development,
    working code (and automated tests) are being considered as the most important
    team artifacts. Is modeling not needed any more? Is UML dead? I think that's not
    true. In this article, I'll explore the spaces where modeling fits and plays an
    important role in this Agile age, especially when development scales to multiple
    teams and a shared understanding of the system's "Big Picture" becomes essential.

  Room of Beijing: Meeting Room 5
  Speaker Introduction: I'm Ariel HAN, from Beijing CBC/XEL department. I'm a software
    engineer and the Scrum master of one team.
  Abstract: "Our team is working for the CMCC fast track feature development and lab
    test support.\nOur project condition:\n1. Receive many TR/Issues from lab test
    everyday and the number couldn't be estimated;\n2. Too many urgent and high priority
    features are inserted which break the previous plan;\n3. Multi features/TR/Issues
    on one's hand and are switched frequently. \n4. The features could be started
    or cancelled in a very short time. \nTo adapt agile to our project, we:\n1. Shorten
    our sprint to 2 weeks to avoid suddenly coming features which couldn't wait for
    the next sprint.\n2. Involve feature pre-study of next sprint to current sprint
    to do a earlier forecast and requirement understanding.\n3. Build up team competence
    as deepen their own design area and broaden to others. Let feature relative members
    share the key and short information to make others better involved in those not
    'self relative' tasks.\\\n4. Combine Kanban and Scrum together. \nHow do we decide
    putting one task into Kanban or Scrum?\n- We have both work package PO and TR
    PO, working together for the task assignment and priority decision.\n- Tasks with
    high priority, easy to estimate and hard to be removed during 1 sprint will be
    added in Scrum.\n- Tasks as TRs, Issues, feature verification support, workshop,
    pre-study ect will be added in Kanban.\nHow does PO balance the Scrum and Kanban
    work?\n- 2mhr security time for Kanban, could be added in planning meeting according
    to tasks' priority.\n- If we commit more on Kanban, then we commit less on Scrum
    and vice versa.\nHow do we run the daily standup meeting?\n- One board, two diagram
    (burn-down chart for scrum, task effort chart for kanban)\n- Update Scrum and
    Kanban tasks status, check our speed and decide what to do today. If faster on
    Scrum, someone could be involved more in Kanban.\n- All done in 15min, list all
    block issues and make group discussion after the meeting.\n \nWhy do we put sharing
    tasks in Kanban?\n- In Scrum, sharing is too easy to be removed by inserted tasks,
    so we didn't put it into scrum because it always left at the end...\n- In Kanban,
    when someone has no ongoing task, he could put the sharing tasks into Kanban immediately.\n-
    In Kanban, new sharing task could be created immediately when we fix some issues
    or finish some pre-study to avoid forgetting it.\n \nHow do we check the result
    on the sprint end?\n- For Scrum,  we will check how many committed User Stories
    have pass.\n- For Kanban, we will check how many TR/Issues/Sharing we finished.
    Pick out the tasks stay in Kanban for a long time for lesson learned.\n"

    test framework and strategy, to make the automation more elegant and more effective
    to support the team to deliver high quality product as well as enjoying automation

  Abstract: "Automation test is the key to successful agile development, which frees
    the team to deliver high-quality code frequently. Automated build, deployment
    and test scripts ensure reliability as well as allow the team to do its best work
    at all times. \n \nWhile in the real word, there're always some actual barriers:
    \n--The code tends to change frequently during development, how can automated
    tests catch up with it?\n-- The GUI automation test always cost a lot of effort,
    how can we change it from dark ages to successfully automation in an agile environment?\n--
    End-to-end tests are particularly tricky to automate, how can we implement it
    elegantly?\n-- The team has hundreds, even thousands of automated test cases to
    maintain, if we fail to easily making the changes to existing test, the big suited
    of automated test cases can turn into headache. How can we avoid this?\n-- Writing
    automation test for legacy code with few or no tests is a daunting task, how can
    we complete them while at the same time working for new code?\n-- When iteration
    doesn't??t proceed smoothly and the team failed to complete the tasks planned,
    automation test will always be the task don't have time to finish, how can we
    avoid it?\n \nHow can we overcome these barriers? How can automation test let
    the team maximize its velocity while maintaining a high standard?\nIn this presentation,
    we would share some practical experience on:\n-- How to apply agile values, principles
    and practices to develop automation test strategy in agile development\n-- How
    to develop an elegant automation framework to support the team's effective automated
    tests\n"

  Title: Better Retrospective?!
  Start time: 10/16/2013 14:00
  Stop time: 10/16/2013 15:00
  Room of Beijing: VIP Room 2
  Speaker Introduction: Bob Jiang, software engineer of DUCI Beijing, Agile Coach
    of RnD NEA Agile Coaching team. He worked for Ericsson from 2006, focusing on
    CDMA/GSM core network management OAM system. He loves visualization, facilitation,
    and agile in life. http://www.bobjiang.com
  Abstract: "Retrospective is one of Scrum ceremonies, which is held by team at the
    end of each Sprint. In this meeting normally we will inspect how we work and adapt
    to new way of working to improve efficiency. \nIt sounds quite straightforward,
    however, it is easy said than done. Retrospectives are supposed to be the stroke
    for continuous improvement engine. The question is ?C are they really? Too many
    times, we have short sessions, saying ??everything went well?? and ??we have no
    improvements needed??.  There are team members unwilling to attend and/or contribute
    to retrospective sessions. What is happening?\nIn this session I will speak about:
    \n? Why Retrospective\n? Bad Smell in Retrospective\n? Personal Retrospective\n?
    Tips/Suggestions for Better Retrospective\n? Today??s Retrospective"

  Speaker Introduction: "Neil Johnson has been working in ASIC and FPGA development
    for more than 10 years. \n\nHe currently holds the position of Principal Consultant
    at XtremeEDA Corp, a design services firm specializing in all aspects of ASIC
    and FPGA development. \n\nNeil is also co-moderator for AgileSoC.com, a site dedicated
    to the introduction of Agile development methods to the world of hardware development."
  Abstract: Agile software development methods have been adapted to and applied in
    a number of other areas. ASIC/FPGA development, however, with its big bang development
    and delivery model is an area where agile is strangely absent. Based on the four
    values of the Agile Manifesto, this talk presents an overview for how agile methods
    can be applied in hardware development.

  Speaker Introduction: My name is Kevin LIN as the  Manager of PIV Beijing BU Modems.
    I have a 7 year history in Ericsson from I&V manager to Software manager and to
    Hardware manager and to I&V manager again. But it is not the same I&V manager
    again after this journey and after being the NDO Agile/Lean driver. Looking forward
    to exchange ideas with you in the conference.
  Abstract: |
    No matter you are running traditional team or scrum team, to motivate team member is always a big challenge of lean managers/Scrum masters. Despite what we usually do to encouraging people taking challenge, is there other way around to build a team that is always asking What We Can Change? Yes, one of the approach that you can try is making things visible. Including achievement/lesson learned/project status/responsibility.. Everything that can be visible, make them being visible as much as possible.

    From this presentation, we will have a deep dive on two typical scenarios on traditional team operation; newly formed scrum team. Then we can see how team member feel great by advertising/visualizing their achievement. How we can increase the trust between team members by talking/posting about achievement. How we handle failures. And some suggestion you should be careful when you want to go with this approach.

  Abstract: "Continuous Integration Machine -- a systematically developed product\n\nPDU
    WCDMA RBS CI has 1.5 years practice from lean and Agile to be able give the fast
    feedback towards XFT and contribute the SW quality statement towards the SW releasing
    to market.\n\nAs the journey of CII Agile practice, there was no list of functionality
    that the WCDMA RBS CI machine should have, there were no real detailed requirements,
    and no pre-studies existed on how to automate certain test cases that had never
    been automated. Really we had next to nothing except our own ideas and vision.
    The software practice of CI was something new to us, so we did not have someone
    to base our machine development on and learn from. \n\nWhat is continuous integration
    for us? How do we develop the continuous integration machine? How make our customers
    (XFT and track management) would have confidence in using and would trust our
    machine? And do we need and how make a CI machine evaluation plan?\nIn the presentation
    I will cover the following:\n- What we think continuous integration is, it is
    a systematically developed product\n- How we make the continuous integration machine
    and the status of continuous integration of PDU WCDMA RBS\no Roadmap, execution

  Room of Beijing: VIP Room 2
  Speaker Introduction: My name is Clare Bao. I have been in Ericsson for 8 years,
    and took two years of ScM already. This year,  I was Agile Coach. Another colleague
    who help to prepare this topic of ??Art in Agile?? is Benny Zhang, he is ScM.
    Both of us are coming from MC MCP Shanghai. Our Organization has adapted to Lean
    and Agile WoW for around four years.
  Abstract: "Art is a method of non-verbal communication tool, through artistic activities
    to provide a platform for people can freely convey his self-conscious and the
    subconscious, \nto become the most like a psychological analysis, the most affinity
    interactive way. \n\nIn Agile WoW, it highly focus on interactions between people.
    Therefore, communication becomes more and more important. Art is a way to communicate
    more transparently,\ndeeply and funnily. During four years journey of Agile, we
    practiced many art activities in our ceremonies as: \n-Literature \n-Aesthetics
    \n-Filmology \n-Architecture \nIn this presentation, we will share our good practices
    all about Art! From these artistic activities, we can hear voice from team member??s
    heart and communicate deeply in the soul. \nMoreover, these artistic activities
    are quite novel and interesting. Let??s say that ??Lean and Agile is not only
    a theory, we can also fill in them with a lot of fun!??\n"

    and numerous articles and is an internationally known presenter on topics related
    to patterns, retrospectives, influence strategies, agile development, and the
    change process."
  Abstract: "Project Retrospectives are an important part of any software development
    process. \n\nThe Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto state that, \"At regular
    intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
    its behavior accordingly.\" \n\nHow can this be done? \n\nBy taking the time to
    reflect and learn and proactively determine what should be done differently in
    the next iteration, release, or project. \n\nLinda's presentation will introduce
    techniques for project retrospectives, whether they are agile or not. The techniques
    help teams discover what they're doing well so that successful practices can continue
    and identify what should be done differently to improve performance. Retrospectives
    are not finger pointing or blaming sessions, but rather a highly effective process
    in which teams reflect on the past to become more productive in the future. \n\nLinda
    will share her experiences with leading retrospectives of several kinds for dozens
    of projects - successful and unsuccessful, small and large, in academia and industry.
    Her lessons learned can be applied to any project to enable teams and organizations
    to become learning organizations. \n"

  Speaker Introduction: Hi, I'm Jessica Pan, I'm an advanced project manager in DUIB
    China. In the upcoming 2013 RNEA Lean and Agile conference, I will share some
    portfolio management experience I got from FDC NMS. Welcome to join, See U there.
  Abstract: "Portfolio Management in Agile environment is an interesting and challenging
    topic. Many factors impact the final decisions:  capacity, competence, strategy,
    schedule, cost, flexibility, stability, etc., in some extend, it's \"the art of
    balance\".\n \nWhen a feature is not big enough therefore it doesn't need the
    whole XFT, how to handle the idle resources? Normally the demands to resource
    are up and down through the whole feature lifecycle, how to keep the team stable
    while the resource can still be utilized efficiently? When product line and release
    PM require a feature commitment at the early stage of a feature, how to balance
    the flexibility and the commitment? These are the challenges I face everyday.
    \n \nI would like to use this presentation to share the practice in PDU NMS, and
    how we handle above challenges in our daily work. The high-level agenda will include:
    \n- capability management \n- assignment handling and scenario planning \n- fit
    feature into a release frame \n- A useful tool for portfolio management "

    My name is Roy Ke, from BNET DUCI CDMA Core. Now I am working on continuous integration for GSM-N.
  Abstract: "Stories of CI Evolution Journey\n\nThis is a joint presentation from
    DUIB China R&D Ops and DUCI GZ.\n\nAs we always say, Agile transformation is a
    journey. It is also a journey to setup a Continuous Integration framework for
    a project from scratch. \n\nIn DUIB China NDO SP, we started our CI journey in
    year 2011. When we look back, there are lots of exciting achievements along the
    road.  DUIB China CI maturity model evaluates CI deployment from 5 dimensions
    which are building, deploying, testing, reporting and culture. It's a frame of
    reference for us to self-inspect on \"where we are\" and \"where to go\". Based
    on the measurement in the model, NDO SP has finished a giant leap from \"BASE\"
    level to \"INTERMEDIATE\" level in most of the dimensions. In the presentation,
    we will share our essential train of thought and good practices to our audience.\n\nIn
    GUCI GZ, we are deploying CI upon a legacy system ?C GSM-N, which has served TELCO
    over 40 years. During our way to CI, private system in GSM-N is the biggest impediment.
    After a bout one year??s adventure, now we have achieved LLV building and LLV/LSV
    verification in our CI platform. Here we??d like to share our experiences on dealing
    with legacy and private systems, hope it can help teams who are facing same problems.\n"

  Abstract: |
    Gathering requirements and writing good user stories are always challenging. There are no standard processes or notations available to help gather them from the users. Without strong interpersonal communication and facilitation skills, the process can fail, leading towards lack of understanding of what the users really wish. In this talk, I try to show a path to overcome these obstacles by mindmapping.
    Through the simplicity and serenity of mind mapping, we will explore the ??User Wish?? - a vague shape of requirements before they are formalized. And turn them into user stories or use cases.  This session includes a demonstration of the user interview using mindmapping techniques.

    Ericsson with different roles (SW engineer, Team Leader, Product Owner and Portfolio
    Manager).
  Abstract: |
    Presentation: Technical person but also businessman

    PDU people/the engineer are usually considered as technical person, who are not that close to the market and mainly focus on doing things right. But we UPG team make some changes here. UPG is a very young node in UDM family, which is the enabler for data monetization/big data. Considering survival and grow up in this competitive market, it??s extremely important for UPG R&D team to enhance market responsiveness by close collaborating with customers/region and shorten E2E feedback loop. This presentation will show how UPG R&D team are active on customer engagement and pre-sales support to upsell UPG as businessman, which also benefits the UPG agile development for requirement clarification, prioritization and business value understanding to do the right thing.

    background. Certified Scrum Master with rich experience in whole software design
    lifecycle. \n"
  Abstract: "At the beginning of agile journey, we may often face a same problem.
    \"Are we going to use Scrum or Kanban?\" For the pure XFTs, it is easy for them
    to choose. But for\nsome teams who play a different role within a R&D organization,
    it is not easy. LSV team in NDO IPOS and Infrastructure team in NDO SP are two
    typical examples.\nThey both chose Scrum at the start. They had almost everything
    needed in a Scrum setup, like Scrum master, planning meeting, retrospective meeting
    and demo ect.\n\nBut after running for several sprints, they both met obstacles.
    The high priority tasks kept coming in now and then. The sprint plan was interrupted.
    They can not \nfinish all the planned tasks to meet the schedule.\n\nThen they
    started to think about change. And they turned to Kanban. Without time box limited,
    they can easily handle the incoming urgent tasks and prioritize the backlog\nmore
    freely. They focused more on the work flow. Team members work more closely and
    the quality is secured as well.\n"

  Speaker Introduction: "My name is Alvin Hu. \nI come from DUIB china, Packet Core
    Shanghai, SGSN-MME department. \nAnd as a designer, I have been working on SGSN-MME??s
    infrastructure area for more than two years.\n"
  Abstract: "In SGSN-MME product, we have around 8000 TTCN test cases and 35000 GTT
    (a function test tool for SGSN-MME) test cases for function test, normally each
    test case needs more than 10 seconds to execute. Nowadays we can finish one TTCN
    regression within 15 minutes and one GTT regression within 1 hour on average.
    But back to 2009, the figures to finish one TTCN regression and GTT regression
    were 20 hours and 8 hours. \n\nMy presentation introduces how our infrastructure
    department helps reduce this regression time and shorten the feedback loop from
    days to minutes in the past 5 years.  In the presentation, I will show what we
    have done within infrastructure area, how we use and deploy distributed system,
    virtualization technology and selective regression method to our regression testing.
    Distributed system and virtualization technology let us have the capacity to execute
    more regressions, and selective regression method provides a smart way to reduce
    regression scope and improve the efficiency. All of these tools and technologies
    have been integrated in our integration process to support our product??s CI deployment.

  Room of Beijing: Meeting Room 7
  Speaker Introduction: 
  Abstract: Since functional verification is (very) rarely done early (or even on
    time) by anyone (anywhere), late delivery of hardware is the norm. In this session,
    we look at four characteristics of late delivery that consistently dog functional
    verification teams, particularly those using constrained random verification.
    We'll look at practices that can be used to address those characteristics, including
    TDD, and how they can be used to create a new incremental model for functional
    verification.

  Speaker Introduction: "Changying Sun: DUCI CDMA Beijing advanced project manager,
    working on agile deployment and process improvements from the beginning of 2013.
    \nCDMA OAM Product Integration/Verification manager before 2013. \n"
  Abstract: "For DUCI PDU CDMA R&D, when we move from waterfall development model
    to agile WoW, our previous TL9000 quality management system becomes partly obsolete
    though it was quite excellent in managing the products quality in waterfall model
    before. During this transformation, the team gains obvious benefits from Agile
    WoW such as quick delivery, flexibility, productivity, but people also start to
    concern that in Agile WoW the processes and documents may be easily sacrificed,
    hence the quality might be depressed. Especially our major NA customers have a
    requirement for the suppliers to be TL9000 certified.\nJust like Agile manifesto
    stresses, ??while we value working software and individual interactions more,
    there is still value in processes and documents??.  Hence to better leverage the
    both, we adjusted the old quality management system in a lean approach and defined
    our Agile WoW with compliancy to TL9000 requirements during our Agile transformation.
    This presentation will talk about how we run agile in a way that fulfills TL9000
    requirements on: \n? Simplify processes to avoid overhead on processes/documents;
    \n? Clarify a minimum set of document"

  Abstract: "Test-driven development (TDD is a method of software development in which
    unit testing is repeatedly done on source code. The concept is to \"get something
    working now and perfect it later.\" TDD can produce applications of high quality
    in less time than is possible with older methods. Proper implementation of TDD
    requires the developers and testers to accurately anticipate how the application
    and its features will be used in the real world. Because tests are conducted from
    the very beginning of the design cycle, time and money spent in debugging at later
    stages is minimized. \n\nIn this workshop, firstly we will introduce TDD??s concept
    and values. Then we would invite you to experience how to use TDD - a small hands-on
    programming game with TDD method. After your participation, I believe you will
    definitely know the importance of TDD in programming. Of course, you would probably
    find out some challenges to use TDD. Do not worry about it. We will guide you
    to brainstorm how to overcome the limitations in our TDD Journey. \n\nWe believe
    that there must be certain proper ways to start our TDD journey in our development.
    We can continue to improve the quality daily and daily via TDD.\n"
