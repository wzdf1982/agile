    management to Lean and Agile leadership by changing the environment which is called
    Environment Driven Development. Through the presentation, we will tell you the
    theory combined with our practices during this 4 years\x19 deployment. Instead
    of changing the people themselves, how change our people\x19s behavior through
    changing the environment systematically, including the hard environment, soft
    environment and development environment. \n\nWe will also share the result we

  Title: Make Agile journey smooth by leveraging in-house developed CI framework
  Start time: 10/16/2013 13:00
  Stop time: 10/16/2013 14:00
  Room: Conference Room 3
  Abstract: "This presentation will explain how we in NDO Smart Packet by leveraging
    our CI Framework gradually improve design and test efficiency and how our PM/LM
    use the data presented on CI FW for a better management of the project & team.\nAs
    a product development responsible organization, we need to have very short feedback
    loop to secure productivity, quality and flexibility. \nBefore we have our CI
    FW, our XFTs had to separately trigger some development activities (typically
    for SW upgrade and regression test) manually and wait till the previous step to
    complete then trigger the next step.  This way we think we didn\x19t utilize the
    time and our HW in an efficient way. \nFurthermore, to do the Agile transformation
    we don\x19t want the top-down directive mode, instead we want our XFTs to take
    initiatives to find out the approach for improvement and become self-organized.
    Then we think a CI FW is needed to facilitate the team.\nThe NDO SP CI FW is an
    end-to-end responsible and easy-to-use framework which helps get each link in
    the SW engineering chain (SW build -> static code analysis -> UT -> SW upgrade
    -> regression -> coverage report -> execution result notification) connected.
    And also with the consolidated and easy-to-reach result summary, engineers can
    do trouble shooting easily. As a consequence, team\x19s working efficiency is
    improved a lot. With the job queuing function, the idle time between test jobs
    is further reduced and  the HW utilization ratio are greatly improved.\nIn Agile
    environment, transparency is important in the sense that it makes progress & dependency
    & impediments visible, so that it makes communication between teams or even between
    team and PM/LM more effective and efficient. The visualized information can also
    function as a push force for teams to continuously strive for an even better result.
    The abundant subjective data (e.g. result summary of each step, trend for each
    step) presented on CI FW works facilitate teams to reflect on in which area they
    are doing good and in which area they are not, then proactive actions can be taken
    immediately.\nWith the visualized and consolidated information on out CI FW about
    each team??s work, together with the real time TR statistics info provided by
    our TR dashboard, it "

  Room: Conference Room 6
  Abstract: "Our team is working for the CMCC fast track feature development and lab
    test support.\nOur project condition:\n1. Receive many TR/Issues from lab test
    everyday and the number couldn't be estimated;\n2. Too many urgent and high priority
    features are inserted which break the previous plan;\n3. Multi features/TR/Issues
    on one's hand and are switched frequently. \n4. The features could be started
    or cancelled in a very short time. \nTo adapt agile to our project, we:\n1. Shorten
    our sprint to 2 weeks to avoid suddenly coming features which couldn't wait for
    the next sprint.\n2. Involve feature pre-study of next sprint to current sprint
    to do a earlier forecase and requirement understanding.\n3. Build up team competence
    as deepen their own design area and boarden to others. Let feature relative members
    share the key and short information to make others better involved in those not
    'self relatived' tasks.\\\n4. Combine Kanban and Scrum togther. \nHow do we decide
    putting one task into Kanban or Scrum?\n- We have both workpakage PO and TR PO,
    working toghter for the task assignment and priority decision.\n- Tasks with high
    priority, easy to estimate and hard to be removed during 1 sprint will be added
    in Scrum.\n- Tasks as TRs, Issues, feature verification support, workshop, pre-study
    ect will be added in Kanban.\nHow does PO balance the Scrum and Kanban work?\n-
    2mhr security time for Kanban, could be added in planning meeting according to
    tasks' priority.\n- If we commit more on Kanban, then we commit less on Scrum
    and vice versa.\nHow do we run the daily standup meeting?\n- One board, two diagram
    (burn-down chart for scrum, task effort chart for kanban)\n- Update Scrum and
    Kanban tasks status, check our speed and decide what to do today. If faster on
    Scrum, someone could be involved more in Kanban.\n- All done in 15min, list all
    block issues and make group discussion after the meeting.\n \nWhy do we put sharing
    tasks in Kanban?\n- In Scrum, sharing is too easy to be removed by inserted tasks,
    so we didn't put it into scrum because it always left at the end...\n- In Kanban,
    when someone has no ongoing task, he could put the sharing tasks into Kanban immediately.\n-
    In Kanban, new sharing task could be created immediately when we fix some issues
    or finish some pre-study to avoid forgetting it.\n \nHow do we check the result
    on the sprint end?\n- For Scrum,  we will check how many commited UserStories
    have pass.\n- For Kanban, we will check how many TR/Issues/Sharing we finished.
    Pick out the tasks stay in Kanban for a long time for lesson learned.\n"

    and test scripts ensure reliability as well as allow the team to do its best work
    at all times. \n \nWhile in the real word, there're always some actual barriers:
    \n--The code tends to change frequently during development, how can automated
    tests catch up with it?\n-- The GUI automation test always cost a lot of effort,
    how can we change it from dark ages to successfully automation in an agile environment?\n--
    End-to-end tests are particularly tricky to automate, how can we implement it
    elegantly?\n-- The team has hundreds, even thousands of automated test cases to
    maintain, if we fail to easily making the changes to existing test, the big suited
    of automated test cases can turn into headache. How can we avoid this?\n-- Writing
    automation test for legacy code with few or no tests is a daunting task, how can
    we complete them while at the same time working for new code?\n-- When iteration
    doesn??t proceed smoothly and the team failed to complete the tasks planned, automation
    test will always be the task don't have time to finish, how can we avoid it?\n
    \nHow can we overcome these barriers? How can automation test let the team maximize
    its velocity while maintaining a high standard?\nIn this presentation, we would
    share some practical experience on:\n-- How to apply agile values, principles
    and practices to develop automation test strategy in agile development\n-- How

  Abstract: |
    No matter you are running traditional team or scrum team, to motivate team member is always a big challenge of lean managers/Scrum masters. Despite what we usually do to encouraging people taking challenge, is there other way around to build a team that is always asking What We Can Change? Yes, one of the approach that you can try is making things visible. Including achievement/lesson learned/project status/responsibility.. Everything that can be visible, make them being visible as much as possible.

    From this presentation, we will have a deep dive on two typical scenarios on traditional team operation; newly formed scrum team. Then we can see how team member feel great by advertising/visualizing their achievement. How we can increase the trust between team members by talking/posting about achievement. How we handle failures. And some suggestion you should be careful when you want to go with this approach.

    been automated. Really we had next to nothing except our own ideas and vision.
    The software practice of CI was something new to us, so we did not have someone
    to base our machine development on and learn from. \n\nWhat is continuous integration
    for us? How do we develop the continuous integration machine? How make our customers
    (XFT and track management) would have confidence in using and would trust our
    machine? And do we need and how make a CI machine evaluation plan?\nIn the presentation
    I will cover the following:\n- What we think continuous integration is, it is
    a systematically developed product\n- How we make the continuous integration machine
    and the status of continuous integration of PDU WCDMA RBS\no Roadmap, execution
    WOW\no CI product KPI (stability, effectiveness, automation ratio, coverage??)\no
    Doing continuous improvement through monitoring KPIs, FST, stockholders?? requirements\n-
    Competencies and way of working\n"

  Abstract: "Portfolio Management in Agile environment is an interesting and challenging
    topic. Many factors impact the final decisions:  capacity, competence, strategy,
    schedule, cost, flexibility, stability, etc., in some extend, it's \"the art of
    balance\".\n \nWhen a feature is not big enough therefore it doesn't need the
    whole XFT, how to handle the idle resources? Normally the demands to resource
    are up and down through the whole feature lifecycle, how to keep the team stable
    while the resource can still be utilized efficiently? When product line and release
    PM require a feature commitment at the early stage of a feature, how to balance
    the flexibility and the commitment? These are the challenges I face everyday.
    \n \nI would like to use this presentation to share the practice in PDU NMS, and
    how we handle above challenges in our daily work. The high-level agenda will include:
    \n- capability management \n- assignment handling and scenario planning \n- fit

  Abstract: "Stories of CI Evolution Journey\n\nThis is a joint presentation from
    DUIB China R&D Ops and DUCI GZ.\n\nAs we always say, Agile transformation is a
    journey. It is also a journey to setup a Continuous Integration framework for
    a project from scratch. \n\nIn DUIB China NDO SP, we started our CI journey in
    year 2011. When we look back, there are lots of exciting achievements along the
    road.  DUIB China CI maturity model evaluates CI deployment from 5 dimensions
    which are building, deploying, testing, reporting and culture. It's a frame of
    reference for us to self-inspect on \"where we are\" and \"where to go\". Based
    on the measurement in the model, NDO SP has finished a giant leap from \"BASE\"
    level to \"INTERMEDIATE\" level in most of the dimensions. In the presentation,
    we will share our essential train of thought and good practices to our audience.\n\nIn
    GUCI GZ, we are deploying CI upon a legacy system ?C GSM-N, which has served TELCO
    over 40 years. During our way to CI, private system in GSM-N is the biggest impediment.
    After a bout one year??s adventure, now we have achieved LLV building and LLV/LSV
    verification in our CI platform. Here we??d like to share our experiences on dealing
    with legacy and private systems, hope it can help teams who are facing same problems.\n"

    Presentation: Technical person but also businessman

    PDU people/the engineer are usually considered as technical person, who are not that close to the market and mainly focus on doing things right. But we UPG team make some changes here. UPG is a very young node in UDM family, which is the enabler for data monetization/big data. Considering survival and grow up in this competitive market, it??s extremely important for UPG R&D team to enhance market responsiveness by close collaborating with customers/region and shorten E2E feedback loop. This presentation will show how UPG R&D team are active on customer engagement and pre-sales support to upsell UPG as businessman, which also benefits the UPG agile development for requirement clarification, prioritization and business value understanding to do the right thing.

  Abstract: "At the beginning of agile journey, we may often face a same problem.
    \"Are we going to use Scrum or Kanban?\" For the pure XFTs, it is easy for them
    to choose. But for\nsome teams who play a different role within a R&D organization,
    it is not easy. LSV team in NDO IPOS and Infrastructure team in NDO SP are two
    typical examples.\nThey both chose Scrum at the start. They had almost everything
    needed in a Scrum setup, like Scrum master, planning meeting, retrospective meeting
    and demo ect.\n\nBut after running for several sprints, they both met obstacles.
    The high priority tasks kept coming in now and then. The sprint plan was interrupted.
    They can not \nfinish all the planned tasks to meet the schedule.\n\nThen they
    started to think about change. And they turned to Kanban. Without time box limited,
    they can easily handle the incoming urgent tasks and prioritize the backlog\nmore
    freely. They focused more on the work flow. Team members work more closely and
    the quality is secured as well.\n"

  Start time: 10/17/2013 10:45

  Room: Conference Room 3
  Abstract: "In SGSN-MME product, we have around 8000 TTCN test cases and 35000 GTT
    (a function test tool for SGSN-MME) test cases for function test, normally each
    test case needs more than 10 seconds to execute. Nowadays we can finish one TTCN
    regression within 15 minutes and one GTT regression within 1 hour on average.
    But back to 2009, the figures to finish one TTCN regression and GTT regression
    were 20 hours and 8 hours. \n\nMy presentation introduces how our infrastructure
    department helps reduce this regression time and shorten the feedback loop from
    days to minutes in the past 5 years.  In the presentation, I will show what we
    have done within infrastructure area, how we use and deploy distributed system,
    virtualization technology and selective regression method to our regression testing.
    Distributed system and virtualization technology let us have the capacity to execute
    more regressions, and selective regression method provides a smart way to reduce
    regression scope and improve the efficiency. All of these tools and technologies
    have been integrated in our integration process to support our product??s CI deployment.

  Start time: 10/17/2013 10:45

  Room: VIP 1
  Abstract: "For DUCI PDU CDMA R&D, when we move from waterfall development model
    to agile WoW, our previous TL9000 quality management system becomes partly obsolete
    though it was quite excellent in managing the products quality in waterfall model
    before. During this transformation, the team gains obvious benefits from Agile
    WoW such as quick delivery, flexibility, productivity, but people also start to
    concern that in Agile WoW the processes and documents may be easily sacrificed,
    hence the quality might be depressed. Especially our major NA customers have a
    requirement for the suppliers to be TL9000 certified.\nJust like Agile manifesto
    stresses, ??while we value working software and individual interactions more,
    there is still value in processes and documents??.  Hence to better leverage the
    both, we adjusted the old quality management system in a lean approach and defined
    our Agile WoW with compliancy to TL9000 requirements during our Agile transformation.
    This presentation will talk about how we run agile in a way that fulfills TL9000
    requirements on: \n? Simplify processes to avoid overhead on processes/documents;
    \n? Clarify a minimum set of documen"

  Abstract: "Test-driven development (TDD is a method of software development in which
    unit testing is repeatedly done on source code. The concept is to \"get something
    working now and perfect it later.\" TDD can produce applications of high quality
    in less time than is possible with older methods. Proper implementation of TDD
    requires the developers and testers to accurately anticipate how the application
    and its features will be used in the real world. Because tests are conducted from
    the very beginning of the design cycle, time and money spent in debugging at later
    stages is minimized. \n\nIn this workshop, firstly we will introduce TDD??s concept
    and values. Then we would invite you to experience how to use TDD - a small hands-on
    programming game with TDD method. After your participation, I believe you will
    definitely know the importance of TDD in programming. Of course, you would probably
    find out some challenges to use TDD. Do not worry about it. We will guide you
    to brainstorm how to overcome the limitations in our TDD Journey. \n\nWe believe
    that there must be certain proper ways to start our TDD journey in our development.
    We can continue to improve the quality daily and daily via TDD.\n"

  Stop time: 10/17/2013 15:00
  Room: Conference Room 6
  Abstract: "Two fallacies in product development: \n? High utilization of resources
    will improve performance \n   Does it take into full account the intrinsic variability
    of development work? \n   Does it understand how queues affect economic performance?
    \n? The sooner the project is started, the sooner it will be finished \n   Does
    it lead companies to start more projects than they can vigorously pursue. \n   The
    slower a project progresses, what is the chance for project to stay? \n\nPDU WMR
    conclusion \n- What should we do about Flow? \n- How should we treat Cost of Delay?
    \n- How to manage queues? \n- What does Flow and Queuing theory help us to increase
    productivity and feature delivery? \n\nPDU WMR Practice in Flow product development:
    \n- WCDMA has doubled its delivery (number of feature), comfortably release on
    time. The momentum of productivity increasing is still strong. \n- Reducing TR
    dramatically on both Main and PLM track after 18 month Agile transformation. We
    are reducing PLM team each year. \n- WCDMA is aiming for delivering SW each Sprint
    to SP instead few release each year in 2014. \n"

    Visualization-A transparent window to the sunshine
    Visualization is always an important part in agile which has many benefits to the team. Besides the traditional transparency methods, I will share some more visualization methods that we used in our agile practice.
    1. Visual board??physical visual board and E board (Hansoft).
    2. Retro Footprint?? a way to visualize the retro result and team level measurement.
    3. TV lives??a vivid and diverse way showing our team??s condition.
    4. Open door?? an open atmosphere to welcome any stakeholders.

    and how to deal with conflicts, could be one of most widely controversial concerns.\nIn
    this presentation, Speaker will try to answer the essence of Conflict Management
    in Agile, and his proposition.\n                Meanwhile, you could find some
    interesting answer in different angles for below questions. \n? What are the conflicts?\n?
    Are conflicts positive or negative to Agile?\n? What particular kinds of conflict
    (with real cases) are in Agile? \n? How to handle the conflicts in Agile?\n? What
    are conflict management strategies?\n"

  Abstract: "MSDP Continuous Integration and Testing system in BUSS CoE Service Enablement\nA
    full Multiservice Delivery Platform (MSDP) package is integrated by 300+ components/modules,
    which are developed by ~100 engineers. In order to make everything integrated
    in time and keep the product quality always visualized, Continuous Integration
    (CI) is well developed and managed in MSDP to ensure everything goes smoothly
    and refreshed frequently. \n\nCI setup in MSDP includes the functionalities to
    automatically and continuously do: \n- Timely component building, unit testing
    and code reviewing ; \n- Hourly product package integrating, deploying and system
    testing; \n- Nightly formal package delivering; \n- Daily performance testing;
    \n- Weekly duration testing; \n\nSmart, clear and well organized CI systems are
    the key to make above jobs working smoothly, especially when the branch and job
    numbers are big (6 CI systems in MSDP and 100+ jobs in each CI system).  High
    efficient CI setup, good quality control and useful Jenkins plugins make MSDP
    CI in an efficient way.\n\nFrom environment setting, product building, deploying,
    testing and reporting perspective, MSDP CI is mostly in Advanced level. Let??s
    improve together!\n"

  Abstract: "At the beginning of our agile evolution, almost all of our team members
    had negative attitude. To be, or not to be, that is a question. Many teams might
    have the similar past. But now we are all happy with Agile & Kanban. Do you want
    to know why? \nIn this presentation, I will show how we solved the problems happened
    in the evolution. There is no any agile theoretical propaganda, but several real
