    change are not always welcomed with open arms. Linda Rising offers proven change
    management strategies to help you become a more successful agent of change in
    your organization. Learn how to plant effective seeds of change, and what forces
    in your organization drive or block change. In addition to using these approaches
    to change your organization, you can use them to become a more effective person--these
    strategies or patterns are useful in many different settings. Linda shows how
    these lessons from her book, Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas,

    delight team and embrace Lean and Agile.
  Abstract: |-
    One of Lean and Agile principles is to defer commitment as much as we can, but early commitment is highly demanded in a contract bind project from our customer. Is this a conflict? How shall we deal with it? You might have similar questions as we do while you start the Lean & Agile journey:  How to transit to Lean & Agile WoW in a timing-critical customer program?  How should portfolio be set up to satisfy customer needs in Lean & Agile environment?  What values can we bring to customers via Lean & Agile, only a faster delivery?  How to satisfy customer needs while keep team motivated and growing continuously?

    We will share with you the learning journey we went through in the past 4 year, starting from scratches to a mature Lean/Agile portfolio.

  Speaker Introduction: 'I am Weijia Lu from MC MCP SH. Currently, I am an agile coach.
    I have been in Agile Journey for 4 years and acted as the role of team member,
    scrum master and agile coach. '
  Abstract: "The Agile Manifesto has made a big impact on software development around
    the world in a matter of 10 years. Granted, we're not done yet. But we've made
    significant progress. However, it seems the Arctic Ocean will have melted before
    we see traditional management being replaced with a new paradigm.'-- David Bornstein,
    How to change the world [David, 2007] \n\nWe change our traditional management
    to Lean and Agile leadership by changing the environment which is called Environment
    Driven Development. Through the presentation, we will tell you the theory combined
    with our practices during this 4 years' deployment. Instead of changing the people
    themselves, how change our people's behavior through changing the environment
    systematically, including the hard environment, soft environment and development
    environment. \n\nWe will also share the result we got and the lessons we learnt
    by changing the environment. You will hear a lot of interesting practical stories
    happened in this period of environment change; you can also hear the voices from
    the team members feedback."

  Title: Make Agile Journey Smooth by Leveraging In-house Developed CI Framework
  Start time: 10/16/2013 13:00
  Stop time: 10/16/2013 14:00
  Room of Beijing: Meeting Room 3
  Speaker Introduction: manager of Infrastructure team, NDO SP, PDU IP System, DUIB
  Abstract: "This presentation will explain how we in NDO Smart Packet by leveraging
    our CI Framework gradually improve design and test efficiency and how our PM/LM
    use the data presented on CI FW for a better management of the project & team.\nAs
    a product development responsible organization, we need to have very short feedback
    loop to secure productivity, quality and flexibility. \nBefore we have our CI
    FW, our XFTs had to separately trigger some development activities (typically
    for SW upgrade and regression test) manually and wait till the previous step to
    complete then trigger the next step.  This way we think we didn't utilize the
    time and our HW in an efficient way. \nFurthermore, to do the Agile transformation
    we don't want the top-down directive mode, instead we want our XFTs to take initiatives
    to find out the approach for improvement and become self-organized. Then we think
    a CI FW is needed to facilitate the team.\nThe NDO SP CI FW is an end-to-end responsible
    and easy-to-use framework which helps get each link in the SW engineering chain
    (SW build -> static code analysis -> UT -> SW upgrade -> regression -> coverage
    report -> execution result notification) connected. And also with the consolidated
    and easy-to-reach result summary, engineers can do trouble shooting easily. As
    a consequence, team's working efficiency is improved a lot. With the job queuing
    function, the idle time between test jobs is further reduced and  the HW utilization
    ratio are greatly improved.\nIn Agile environment, transparency is important in
    the sense that it makes progress & dependency & impediments visible, so that it
    makes communication between teams or even between team and PM/LM more effective
    and efficient. The visualized information can also function as a push force for
    teams to continuously strive for an even better result. The abundant subjective
    data (e.g. result summary of each step, trend for each step) presented on CI FW
    works facilitate teams to reflect on in which area they are doing good and in
    which area they are not, then proactive actions can be taken immediately.\nWith
    the visualized and consolidated information on out CI FW about each team's work,
    together with the real time TR statistics info provided by our TR dashboard, it
    makes it easier for PM/LM to have a good understanding about current quality status
    and quality risks of our product.\nWithout proper tools?? support, our Agile transformation
    wouldn't get to current lever so smoothly. \nWant to hear more detail or even
    some real cases about how we gradually address our problems one by one along the
    journey to Agile by leveraging our CI framework? Come to our presentation."

    & CI workshop with Guangzhou ,Beijing and Shanghai which across organizations.
    I??m focus on git/gerrit and Jenkins more than 3 years. And love them so much!
  Abstract: "Since more and more colleague changing from clearcase to git/gerrit,
    and gerrit based code review is the one of the best way to enhance our code quality.
    \nAt the beginning we always encounter some difficulties and strive to find the
    better way to increase our efficiency and really hope the tool could help us in
    daily work. \nHow to use the tools in smart way? How about the strategy? which
    is the best approach? which solution to choose for different business needs?  \nSo
    in my presentation I will introduce:\nfirstly, why code review? will cover basic
    concept and types of code review, and give a brief introduction about structure
    and fundamental of git, gerrit and Jenkins, also let you know how gerrit do the
    code review\nSecondly, some good experience on how deploy gerrit, there are approach
    you could choose by business needs, these good activity comes from different site,
    some are task based code review, some are feature based code review etc. it's
    very flexible and could customized by project. And give some reason behind why
    you select the strategy and what's the benefit.\n"

  Title: Modeling in the Agile Age
  Start time: 10/16/2013 13:00
  Stop time: 10/16/2013 14:00
  Room of Beijing: Ballroom B
  Speaker Introduction: "Kenji Hiranabe is an Agile software development practitioner
    and consultant in Japan. He thinks of software development as a form of co-operative
    communication game, and is always searching for better ways to make it more productive,
    collaborative, and fun. \n\n2008 Gordon Pask Award Recipient for contributions
    to Agile practice. CEO of Change Vision Inc., and Japanese (co-)translator of
    the books including \"Multi-Paradigm Design\", \"C# Primer\", \"Lean Software
    Development\", \"XP Installed\", \"Agile Project Management\". Also a developer
    of \"JUDE\" a UML editor software integrated with Mind Mapping, and \"TRICHORD,\"
    a Kanban-based Agile project information sharing tool. "
  Abstract: Now that Agile methods have become mainstream in software development,
    working code (and automated tests) are being considered as the most important
    team artifacts. Is modeling not needed any more? Is UML dead? I think that's not
    true. In this article, I'll explore the spaces where modeling fits and plays an
    important role in this Agile age, especially when development scales to multiple
    teams and a shared understanding of the system's "Big Picture" becomes essential.

  Room of Beijing: Meeting Room 5
  Speaker Introduction: I'm Ariel HAN, from Beijing CBC/XEL department. I'm a software
    engineer and the Scrum master of one team.
  Abstract: "Our team is working for the CMCC fast track feature development and lab
    test support.\nOur project condition:\n1. Receive many TR/Issues from lab test
    everyday and the number couldn't be estimated;\n2. Too many urgent and high priority
    features are inserted which break the previous plan;\n3. Multi features/TR/Issues
    on one's hand and are switched frequently. \n4. The features could be started
    or cancelled in a very short time. \nTo adapt agile to our project, we:\n1. Shorten
    our sprint to 2 weeks to avoid suddenly coming features which couldn't wait for
    the next sprint.\n2. Involve feature pre-study of next sprint to current sprint
    to do a earlier forecast and requirement understanding.\n3. Build up team competence
    as deepen their own design area and broaden to others. Let feature relative members
    share the key and short information to make others better involved in those not
    'self relative' tasks.\\\n4. Combine Kanban and Scrum together. \nHow do we decide
    putting one task into Kanban or Scrum?\n- We have both work package PO and TR
    PO, working together for the task assignment and priority decision.\n- Tasks with
    high priority, easy to estimate and hard to be removed during 1 sprint will be
    added in Scrum.\n- Tasks as TRs, Issues, feature verification support, workshop,
    pre-study ect will be added in Kanban.\nHow does PO balance the Scrum and Kanban
    work?\n- 2mhr security time for Kanban, could be added in planning meeting according
    to tasks' priority.\n- If we commit more on Kanban, then we commit less on Scrum
    and vice versa.\nHow do we run the daily standup meeting?\n- One board, two diagram
    (burn-down chart for scrum, task effort chart for kanban)\n- Update Scrum and
    Kanban tasks status, check our speed and decide what to do today. If faster on
    Scrum, someone could be involved more in Kanban.\n- All done in 15min, list all
    block issues and make group discussion after the meeting.\n \nWhy do we put sharing
    tasks in Kanban?\n- In Scrum, sharing is too easy to be removed by inserted tasks,
    so we didn't put it into scrum because it always left at the end...\n- In Kanban,
    when someone has no ongoing task, he could put the sharing tasks into Kanban immediately.\n-
    In Kanban, new sharing task could be created immediately when we fix some issues
    or finish some pre-study to avoid forgetting it.\n \nHow do we check the result
    on the sprint end?\n- For Scrum,  we will check how many committed User Stories
    have pass.\n- For Kanban, we will check how many TR/Issues/Sharing we finished.
    Pick out the tasks stay in Kanban for a long time for lesson learned.\n"

  Speaker Introduction: "I have played different roles -- developer, tester, test
    leader, system analyzer, scrum master and agile testing coach, and my automation
    test experience started since 2007 while my agile experience started since 2008.
    \nDuring the pass 6+ years, I work with the team to keep practicing and improving
    automation test framework and strategy, to make the automation more elegant and
    more effective to support the team to deliver high quality product as well as
    enjoying automation test."
  Abstract: "Automation test is the key to successful agile development, which frees
    the team to deliver high-quality code frequently. Automated build, deployment
    and test scripts ensure reliability as well as allow the team to do its best work
    at all times. \n \nWhile in the real word, there're always some actual barriers:
    \n--The code tends to change frequently during development, how can automated
    tests catch up with it?\n-- The GUI automation test always cost a lot of effort,
    how can we change it from dark ages to successfully automation in an agile environment?\n--
    End-to-end tests are particularly tricky to automate, how can we implement it
    elegantly?\n-- The team has hundreds, even thousands of automated test cases to
    maintain, if we fail to easily making the changes to existing test, the big suited
    of automated test cases can turn into headache. How can we avoid this?\n-- Writing
    automation test for legacy code with few or no tests is a daunting task, how can
    we complete them while at the same time working for new code?\n-- When iteration
    doesn't??t proceed smoothly and the team failed to complete the tasks planned,
    automation test will always be the task don't have time to finish, how can we
    avoid it?\n \nHow can we overcome these barriers? How can automation test let
    the team maximize its velocity while maintaining a high standard?\nIn this presentation,
    we would share some practical experience on:\n-- How to apply agile values, principles
    and practices to develop automation test strategy in agile development\n-- How
    to develop an elegant automation framework to support the team's effective automated
    tests\n"

    again after this journey and after being the NDO Agile/Lean driver. Looking forward
    to exchange ideas with you in the conference.
  Abstract: |
    No matter you are running traditional team or scrum team, to motivate team member is always a big challenge of lean managers/Scrum masters. Despite what we usually do to encouraging people taking challenge, is there other way around to build a team that is always asking What We Can Change? Yes, one of the approach that you can try is making things visible. Including achievement/lesson learned/project status/responsibility.. Everything that can be visible, make them being visible as much as possible.

    From this presentation, we will have a deep dive on two typical scenarios on traditional team operation; newly formed scrum team. Then we can see how team member feel great by advertising/visualizing their achievement. How we can increase the trust between team members by talking/posting about achievement. How we handle failures. And some suggestion you should be careful when you want to go with this approach.

  Abstract: "Continuous Integration Machine -- a systematically developed product\n\nPDU
    WCDMA RBS CI has 1.5 years practice from lean and Agile to be able give the fast
    feedback towards XFT and contribute the SW quality statement towards the SW releasing
    to market.\n\nAs the journey of CII Agile practice, there was no list of functionality
    that the WCDMA RBS CI machine should have, there were no real detailed requirements,
    and no pre-studies existed on how to automate certain test cases that had never
    been automated. Really we had next to nothing except our own ideas and vision.
    The software practice of CI was something new to us, so we did not have someone
    to base our machine development on and learn from. \n\nWhat is continuous integration
    for us? How do we develop the continuous integration machine? How make our customers
    (XFT and track management) would have confidence in using and would trust our
    machine? And do we need and how make a CI machine evaluation plan?\nIn the presentation

    Business Communication Suite and Broadcast over LTE. During this time he has been
    a part of the transformation of testing towards an Agile way of working and has
    been driving this change.
  Abstract: "Abstract description:     Quality control in Agile in BUSS Shanghai \nAgile
    is implemented long time ago in BUSS shanghai. What we care about is not only
    the WoW, but the product quality and efficiency. Better quality control is always
    our focus. Several good practice to share here. \nContent: \n1. Short Quality
    feedback loop \nAll products in BUSS Shanghai share common CI strategy/guide make
    our quality insurance work visualized in time. Examples of product adaption for
    different situation, we continuously learn from others's strong points to offset
    one's weakness and share environment setup work to be more efficient. \nUseful
    tools integrated with CI work to control each phase quality. Such as Gerit for
    code review; Sonar for better monitor and control UT coverage; Heatmap, track
    FT failed cases as input of later test anatomy and case improvement; Jacoco, another
    angle of test coverage; Zabbix, performance ST report of system usage. \n\n2.
    Quality feedback loop by FST (Fault Slip Through), which bring deeper analysis
    on why and how to improve. \n Through analysis->feedback->deploy, each party of
    the product insurance (requirement owner, technical writer, designer, tester)
    keep improving our quality in each area. \n\nLearning of those practice: \nThe
    first step is make product quality visualization timely, different time loop for
    different purpose. Not only visible but also stable and automized framework make
    us focus on product quality itself. \nCI means not only Continuous Integration
    but also Continuous Improvement. During product development, we use variable kinds
    of feedback loop to make us take effort on the right direction and right way."

    who help to prepare this topic of "Art in Agile" is Benny Zhang, he is ScM. Both
    of us are coming from MC MCP Shanghai. Our Organization has adapted to Lean and
    Agile WoW for around four years
  Abstract: "Art is a method of non-verbal communication tool, through artistic activities
    to provide a platform for people can freely convey his self-conscious and the
    subconscious, \nto become the most like a psychological analysis, the most affinity
    interactive way. \n\nIn Agile WoW, it highly focus on interactions between people.
    Therefore, communication becomes more and more important. Art is a way to communicate
    more transparently,\ndeeply and funnily. During four years journey of Agile, we
    practiced many art activities in our ceremonies as: \n-Literature \n-Aesthetics
    \n-Filmology \n-Architecture \nIn this presentation, we will share our good practices
    all about Art! From these artistic activities, we can hear voice from team member??s
    heart and communicate deeply in the soul. \nMoreover, these artistic activities
    are quite novel and interesting. Let's say that \"Lean and Agile is not only a
    theory, we can also fill in them with a lot of fun!\""

    to patterns, retrospectives, influence strategies, agile development, and the
    change process."
  Abstract: "Project Retrospectives are an important part of any software development
    process. \n\nThe Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto state that, \"At regular
    intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
    its behavior accordingly.\" \n\nHow can this be done? \n\nBy taking the time to
    reflect and learn and proactively determine what should be done differently in
    the next iteration, release, or project. \n\nLinda's presentation will introduce
    techniques for project retrospectives, whether they are agile or not. The techniques
    help teams discover what they're doing well so that successful practices can continue
    and identify what should be done differently to improve performance. Retrospectives
    are not finger pointing or blaming sessions, but rather a highly effective process
    in which teams reflect on the past to become more productive in the future. \n\nLinda
    will share her experiences with leading retrospectives of several kinds for dozens
    of projects - successful and unsuccessful, small and large, in academia and industry.
    Her lessons learned can be applied to any project to enable teams and organizations
    to become learning organizations. \n"

    China. In the upcoming 2013 RNEA Lean and Agile conference, I will share some
    portfolio management experience I got from FDC NMS. Welcome to join, See U there.
  Abstract: "Portfolio Management in Agile environment is an interesting and challenging
    topic. Many factors impact the final decisions:  capacity, competence, strategy,
    schedule, cost, flexibility, stability, etc., in some extend, it's \"the art of
    balance\".\n \nWhen a feature is not big enough therefore it doesn't need the
    whole XFT, how to handle the idle resources? Normally the demands to resource
    are up and down through the whole feature lifecycle, how to keep the team stable
    while the resource can still be utilized efficiently? When product line and release
    PM require a feature commitment at the early stage of a feature, how to balance
    the flexibility and the commitment? These are the challenges I face everyday.
    \n \nI would like to use this presentation to share the practice in PDU NMS, and
    how we handle above challenges in our daily work. The high-level agenda will include:
    \n- capability management \n- assignment handling and scenario planning \n- fit
    feature into a release frame \n- A useful tool for portfolio management "

    Roy Ke, from BNET DUCI CDMA Core. Now I am working on continuous integration for GSM-N.
  Abstract: "Stories of CI Evolution Journey\n\nThis is a joint presentation from
    DUIB China R&D Ops and DUCI GZ.\n\nAs we always say, Agile transformation is a
    journey. It is also a journey to setup a Continuous Integration framework for
    a project from scratch. \n\nIn DUIB China NDO SP, we started our CI journey in
    year 2011. When we look back, there are lots of exciting achievements along the
    road.  DUIB China CI maturity model evaluates CI deployment from 5 dimensions
    which are building, deploying, testing, reporting and culture. It's a frame of
    reference for us to self-inspect on \"where we are\" and \"where to go\". Based
    on the measurement in the model, NDO SP has finished a giant leap from \"BASE\"
    level to \"INTERMEDIATE\" level in most of the dimensions. In the presentation,
    we will share our essential train of thought and good practices to our audience.\n\nIn
    GUCI GZ, we are deploying CI upon a legacy system --GSM-N, which has served TELCO
    over 40 years. During our way to CI, private system in GSM-N is the biggest impediment.
    After a bout one year's adventure, now we have achieved LLV building and LLV/LSV
    verification in our CI platform. Here we'd like to share our experiences on dealing
    with legacy and private systems, hope it can help teams who are facing same problems.\n"

  Abstract: |
    Gathering requirements and writing good user stories are always challenging. There are no standard processes or notations available to help gather them from the users. Without strong interpersonal communication and facilitation skills, the process can fail, leading towards lack of understanding of what the users really wish. In this talk, I try to show a path to overcome these obstacles by mindmapping.
    Through the simplicity and serenity of mind mapping, we will explore the"User Wish" - a vague shape of requirements before they are formalized. And turn them into user stories or use cases.  This session includes a demonstration of the user interview using mindmapping techniques.

  Abstract: |
    Presentation: Technical person but also businessman
    PDU people/the engineer are usually considered as technical person, who are not that close to the market and mainly focus on doing things right. But we UPG team makes some changes here. UPG is a very young node in UDM family, which is the enabler for data monetization/big data. Considering survival and grow up in this competitive market, it's extremely important for UPG R&D team to enhance market responsiveness by closely collaborating with customers/region and shortening E2E feedback loop. This presentation will show how the UPG R&D team is active on customer engagement and pre-sales support to upsell UPG as businessman, which also benefits the UPG agile development for requirement clarification, prioritization and business value understanding to do the right thing.

  Abstract: "At the beginning of agile journey, we may often face a same problem.
    \"Are we going to use Scrum or Kanban?\" For the pure XFTs, it is easy for them
    to choose. But for\nsome teams who play a different role within a R&D organization,
    it is not easy. LSV team in NDO IPOS and Infrastructure team in NDO SP are two
    typical examples.\nThey both chose Scrum at the start. They had almost everything
    needed in a Scrum setup, like Scrum master, planning meeting, retrospective meeting
    and demo ect.\n\nBut after running for several sprints, they both met obstacles.
    The high priority tasks kept coming in now and then. The sprint plan was interrupted.
    They can not \nfinish all the planned tasks to meet the schedule.\n\nThen they
    started to think about change. And they turned to Kanban. Without time box limited,
    they can easily handle the incoming urgent tasks and prioritize the backlog\nmore
    freely. They focused more on the work flow. Team members work more closely and
    the quality is secured as well.\n"

  Speaker Introduction: "My name is Alvin Hu. \nI come from DUIB china, Packet Core
    Shanghai, SGSN-MME department. \nAnd as a designer, I have been working on SGSN-MME??s
    infrastructure area for more than two years.\n"
  Abstract: "In SGSN-MME product, we have around 8000 TTCN test cases and 35000 GTT
    (a function test tool for SGSN-MME) test cases for function test, normally each
    test case needs more than 10 seconds to execute. Nowadays we can finish one TTCN
    regression within 15 minutes and one GTT regression within 1 hour on average.
    But back to 2009, the figures to finish one TTCN regression and GTT regression
    were 20 hours and 8 hours. \n\nMy presentation introduces how our infrastructure
    department helps reduce this regression time and shorten the feedback loop from
    days to minutes in the past 5 years.  In the presentation, I will show what we
    have done within infrastructure area, how we use and deploy distributed system,
    virtualization technology and selective regression method to our regression testing.
    Distributed system and virtualization technology let us have the capacity to execute
    more regressions, and selective regression method provides a smart way to reduce
    regression scope and improve the efficiency. All of these tools and technologies
    have been integrated in our integration process to support our product's CI deployment.

  Abstract: Since functional verification is (very) rarely done early (or even on
    time) by anyone (anywhere), late delivery of hardware is the norm. In this session,
    we look at four characteristics of late delivery that consistently dog functional
    verification teams, particularly those using constrained random verification.
    We'll look at practices that can be used to address those characteristics, including
    TDD, and how they can be used to create a new incremental model for functional
    verification.

  Speaker Introduction: "Changying Sun: \nDUCI CDMA Beijing advanced project manager,
    working on agile deployment and process improvements from the beginning of 2013\n\nDella
    Luo: \nCDMA OAM Product Integration/Verification manager before 2013.\n"
  Abstract: "\nFor DUCI PDU CDMA R&D, when we move from waterfall development model
    to agile WoW, our previous TL9000 quality management system becomes partly obsolete
    though it was quite excellent in managing the products quality in waterfall model
    before. During this transformation, the team gains obvious benefits from Agile
    WoW such as quick delivery, flexibility, productivity, but people also start to
    concern that in Agile WoW the processes and documents may be easily sacrificed,
    hence the quality might be depressed. Especially our major NA customers have a
    requirement for the suppliers to be TL9000 certified.\nJust like Agile manifesto
    stresses, \"while we value working software and individual interactions more,
    there is still value in processes and documents\".  Hence to better leverage the
    both, we adjusted the old quality management system in a lean approach and defined
    our Agile WoW with compliancy to TL9000 requirements during our Agile transformation.
    This presentation will talk about how we run agile in a way that fulfills TL9000
    requirements on: \nSimplify processes to avoid overhead on processes/documents;
    \nClarify a minimum set of documents and records to satisfy TL9000 audit and to
    ensure quality and maintainability of the product.\nSimplified project planning/management
    and focus on sprint-based delivery.\nMore flexible change management.\nKeep requirement
    traceability.\nControl of documents and records.\nContinuous improvement.\nImprove
    collaboration with less handovers, and eliminate micro-management."

    Lin Cheng:
    Agile coach in DUCI.SH EI organization. I have worked in Ericsson for 6 years, and 2 years?? experience on coaching team and individuals.
  Abstract: "Test-driven development (TDD is a method of software development in which
    unit testing is repeatedly done on source code. The concept is to \"get something
    working now and perfect it later.\" TDD can produce applications of high quality
    in less time than is possible with older methods. Proper implementation of TDD
    requires the developers and testers to accurately anticipate how the application
    and its features will be used in the real world. Because tests are conducted from
    the very beginning of the design cycle, time and money spent in debugging at later
    stages is minimized. \n\nIn this workshop, firstly we will introduce TDD's concept
    and values. Then we would invite you to experience how to use TDD - a small hands-on
    programming game with TDD method. After your participation, I believe you will
    definitely know the importance of TDD in programming. Of course, you would probably
    find out some challenges to use TDD. Do not worry about it. We will guide you
    to brainstorm how to overcome the limitations in our TDD Journey. \n\nWe believe
    that there must be certain proper ways to start our TDD journey in our development.
    We can continue to improve the quality daily and daily via TDD.\n"

    His currently role is focusing on improve Lean Flow in ENC R&D for productivity
    and quality. His main interest is helping organization to reach ??just in time??.
    He also actively involve with Nanjing Agile Tour community
  Abstract: 'Two fallacies in product development: -- High utilization of resources
    will improve performance  -Does it take into full account the intrinsic variability
    of development work?  -Does it understand how queues affect economic performance?  --The
    sooner the project is started, the sooner it will be finished  -Does it lead companies
    to start more projects than they can vigorously pursue.  -The slower a project
    progresses, what is the chance for project to stay?   PDU WMR conclusion  - What
    should we do about Flow?  - How should we treat Cost of Delay?  - How to manage
    queues?  - What does Flow and Queuing theory help us to increase productivity
    and feature delivery?   PDU WMR Practice in Flow product development:  - WCDMA
    has doubled its delivery (number of feature), comfortably release on time. The
    momentum of productivity increasing is still strong.  - Reducing TR dramatically
    on both Main and PLM track after 18 month Agile transformation. We are reducing
    PLM team each year.  - WCDMA is aiming for delivering SW each Sprint to SP instead
    few release each year in 2014. '

  Abstract: "MSDP Continuous Integration and Testing system in BUSS CoE Service Enablement\nA
    full Multiservice Delivery Platform (MSDP) package is integrated by 300+ components/modules,
    which are developed by ~100 engineers. In order to make everything integrated
    in time and keep the product quality always visualized, Continuous Integration
    (CI) is well developed and managed in MSDP to ensure everything goes smoothly
    and refreshed frequently. \n\nCI setup in MSDP includes the functionalities to
    automatically and continuously do: \n- Timely component building, unit testing
    and code reviewing ; \n- Hourly product package integrating, deploying and system
    testing; \n- Nightly formal package delivering; \n- Daily performance testing;
    \n- Weekly duration testing; \n\nSmart, clear and well organized CI systems are
    the key to make above jobs working smoothly, especially when the branch and job
    numbers are big (6 CI systems in MSDP and 100+ jobs in each CI system).  High
    efficient CI setup, good quality control and useful Jenkins plugins make MSDP
    CI in an efficient way.\n\nFrom environment setting, product building, deploying,
    testing and reporting perspective, MSDP CI is mostly in Advanced level. Let's

    Jiangbiao Deng:
    I am a developer working in DUCI.SH EI organization. I have 6 years working in Ericsson. I worked in BSP product.
    I like programming and enjoy trials of  many software practice to enhance coding quality and efficiency.

    Lin Cheng, agile coach in DUCI.SH EI organization. I have worked in Ericsson for 6 years, and 2 years?? experience on coaching team and individuals.
  Abstract: 'Test-driven development (TDD is a method of software development in which
    unit testing is repeatedly done on source code. The concept is to "get something
    working now and perfect it later." TDD can produce applications of high quality
    in less time than is possible with older methods. Proper implementation of TDD
    requires the developers and testers to accurately anticipate how the application
    and its features will be used in the real world. Because tests are conducted from
    the very beginning of the design cycle, time and money spent in debugging at later
    stages is minimized. '

  Speaker Introduction: "Kenji Hiranabe is an Agile software development practitioner
    and consultant in Japan. He thinks of software development as a form of co-operative
    communication game, and is always searching for better ways to make it more productive,
    collaborative, and fun. \n\n2008 Gordon Pask Award Recipient for contributions
    to Agile practice. CEO of Change Vision Inc., and Japanese (co-)translator of
    the books including \"Multi-Paradigm Design\", \"C# Primer\", \"Lean Software
    Development\", \"XP Installed\", \"Agile Project Management\". Also a developer

    a Kanban-based Agile project information sharing tool. \n"
  Abstract: |-
    Agile concepts are connected to Lean concepts by Mary and Tom Poppendieck via the three Lean Software Development books, but to see the original concepts from the source(TPS) makes your understanding much clearer and more executable. And, you'll experience a lot of Aha moments through this session.

    I'll share the roots of Lean concepts including Kaizen (Continuous Improvement), Gemba (Go See), Muda-Dori (Waste Elimination), WIP limitation, Pull production system, and "People" as the center of the process via a Japanese video showing a factory reconstruction to Lean.
